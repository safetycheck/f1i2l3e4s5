SentenceTransformers Documentation

SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence and text embeddings. 
The initial work is described in our paper Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks.

You can use this framework to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. 
These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. 
This can be useful for semantic textual similar, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.

The framework is based on PyTorch and Transformers and offers a large collection of pre-trained 
models tuned for various tasks. Further, it is easy to fine-tune your own models.
