Predicting the movement of any commodity market is a complex endeavor. Recent studies have shown promising results in applying sentiment analysis methods to stock markets and the Seeker would like to explore the use of similar analysis techniques to aid in the prediction of the world steel market. The Seeker desires an algorithm that takes as input various qualitative data sources such as RSS feeds with news and blogs related to the steel industry and produces a greed/fear numerical index to be used as an input to a complete forecasting model.

This is a Reduction-to-Practice Challenge that requires written documentation, output from the proposed system, and submission of source code and/or executable for validation upon request.
Award: $20,000

SentenceTransformers Documentation

SentenceTransformers is a Python framework for state-of-the-art sentence and text embeddings. 
The initial work is described in our paper Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks.

You can use this framework to compute sentence / text embeddings for more than 100 languages. 
These embeddings can then be compared e.g. with cosine-similarity to find sentences with a similar meaning. 
This can be useful for semantic textual similar, semantic search, or paraphrase mining.

The framework is based on PyTorch and Transformers and offers a large collection of pre-trained 
models tuned for various tasks. Further, it is easy to fine-tune your own models.
